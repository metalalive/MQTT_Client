# This MQTT client library works with verified middleware
# current available options for middlewares :
# * Linux
# * ESP8266_AT_parser (ESP8266 AT library, with FreeRTOS)

#middleware  Linux

# For developers who want to use other third-party cryptography library, they can add new option and
# integrate files of the new cryptography library into this MQTT library.
# current available options for cryptography library:
# * libtomcrypt (default)

#cryptolib  libtomcrypt

# enable TLS protocol in this MQTT library or not, default is yes

#tls  yes

# paths to your certificate / private key that will be used for authentication during TLS
# handshake processes.
# This project only supports DER-encoded X509 certificate and private key files, the code
# generation script simply copies raw hex bytes from every DER file (specified below) to
# global char-array variable. PEM-encoded files have to be converted to DER-encoded format
# beforehand using any tools like OpenSSL utility.

#path_cacert_broker   /path/to/your/CA_cert_for_broker.der

# For mutual (2-way) authentication, client's private key and (non-CA) certificate
# have to be specified

#path_client_cert     /path/to/your/client_cert.der
#path_client_privkey  /path/to/your/client_privkey.der

# MQTT broker address

#brokeraddr  135.7.91.13

# MQTT broker port
#brokerport  1883

# MQTT broker username and password

#brokerusername     your_broker_username
#brokeruserpasswd   your_broker_passwd

# For some middlewares / hardware platforms that don't provide current date / time in real world
# , One can specify the expected date / time on the system initialization, or simply get current
# date time from underlying OS
# For example :
#     sysinithour       11
#     sysinitminutes    8
#     sysinitseconds    30
#     sysinitmonth      2
#     sysinitdate       5
#     sysinityear       2019

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For some middlewares that don't have file system (e.g. RTOS running on microcontroller-based embedded
# device), some data may be stored in memory of the target embedded device.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# wifi username and password, essential for ESP8266_AT_parser, optional for other middlewares.

#wifiusername      your_wifi_SSID
#wifiuserpasswd    your_wifi_passwd

# The operating system used on the target hardware (e.g., freertos-v10).
# This is used by the build system to include OS-specific headers and link against OS libraries.
#os  freertos-v10

# The specific hardware platform (e.g., stm32f446).
# This helps the build system select the correct platform-specific makefiles and configurations.
#hw_platform  stm32f446

# Path to the root directory of your RTOS hardware build environment (e.g., rtos-playground).
# This is crucial for embedded builds as it provides access to RTOS-specific build scripts, includes, and libraries.
#rtos_hw_build_path  /path/to/your/rtos_hw_build

# Path to the home directory of the ESP8266 AT parser project.
# This is specifically required when 'middleware' is set to 'ESP8266_AT_parser' to locate necessary ESP-AT related files.
#esp_proj_home       /path/to/your/esp_project

# Path to the base directory of your cross-compilation toolchain (e.g., ARM GNU toolchain).
# This is essential for embedded builds to correctly invoke the cross-compiler, assembler, and linker.
#toolchain_basepath  /path/to/your/toolchain
